Time Rift Rescue

game-lore: In a world with advanced technology, evil organizations, adventurers and more, 3 scientists are curious about the recently discovered ruins which are rumored to hold an ancient device, capable of travelling through space and time. Intrigued by these rumors, the scientists decide to explore the ruins before anyone else and try to unlock the secrets to time-travelling. They bring with them a famous adventurer, who has survived all by himself in many islands and discovered hidden treasures. To their surprise however, they lose each other while exploring the island and each gets sent to a different ruin entrance. The protagonist, an old friend of theirs and the number one adventurer in the world(who's now retired), gets a call from one of these scientist's colleagues asking him to rescue to them. The protagonist, with no hesitation, sets out to the island in hopes of rescuing them.

Gameplay: The ruins are numbered 1,2,3 and the protagonist has to figure out the correct way of rescuing them by discovering the code on the map(The code is pretty visible when u look at the map after zooming out, it is on the seashore where the rocks are placed as the code). Once the protagonist enters this code, the first ruin in that order gets unlocked. Here he has to kill all the zombies and find the key to rescue his friend from where he is locked.
After rescuing this friend, he gets told to go back to the helicopter and this scientist number 1 goes back.
Now, in the second ruin lies another scientist who is knocked out and needs a medicine to wake up. Luckily, there is a recipe in that room but the adventure has to find the secret area in the same room and press 'E' to get the recipe.(Player can just spam 'E' whlie roaming around the room). After getting the recipe, a monster spawns in the island outside and the protagonist has to defeat that monster to get a drop-item from that monster. Then, the protagonist crafts the potion(with a minecraft like 'crafting' thing) and thus rescues the second scientist as well.
Now, in the third ruin, he finds 2 zombies standing as guard near the ruin entrance. He ponders why they're standing as guards and goes inside after defeating them. After going inside, he finds the 3rd scientist near a table and hears cackling laughter and calls him out. The protagonist would've never guessed that the third scientist had been secretly been working for the 'sekai-seifuku' organization (the world's most evil-organization) and was sent to this island inorder to kill the protagonist here. The protagonist has to then kill the adventurer, that tagged along with the 3 scientists and who had now turned into a zombie, inorder to save himself. After killing the adventurer and knocking the 3rd scientist unconsious, the protagonist falls into a cave and finds the hidden treasure. He has to unlock the chest however, inorder to take this hidden treasure(surprise, surprise, the password is the number whose digits are the number of zombies in every ruin).
Now, the protagonist escapes from this island, never caring to find the time machine, and becomes famous yet again.
(A monkey that slipped in when the door was opened by the protagonist, finds the time machine and presses the "red button". This activates the time machine and we go back to the start of the game).
